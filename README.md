# HalloweenRobotAvatar
A halloween version of my robot avatar, cleaner and easier to work with than my original robot avatar.

If you just want to use the avatar then grab the fbx file, the emissions texture, and the halloween pallet.
Drop it all into a unity project. 
!!! You will need to extract the material from the fbx file in unity to add emission !!!
(If emission isn't important then you can just use the halloween pallet)
Make sure when you import the texture pictures you set filter on them to point/no filter in the Unity inspector otherwise Unity will try to mix the colors.

Blend files provided both merged and unmerged to be able to edit whatever you would like.
